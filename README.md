# Face_Detection_Cam
This is a python program which will be able to detect human faces in the camera live. It will create a rectangular box around the face of the human whoever comes inside the
range of the camera.

To use the program open the "face_detection_cam.py" file where you will be able to see the source code of the project. We are using OpenCV to program the face detection project.
We are using the "face.xml" as the haarcascade file in the openCV. This will detect the human face. We have many more haarcascade files like eyes, smile, lower body etc.
Using this the code will run and the camera will be on, and whenever a face will appear in the range of the webcam, a square will we created around the face. Press "q" to close
the webcam.

Use the "face_detect.py" file to detect faces/smiles/eyes etc in a picture, a square will appear around the human feature you selected in the haarcascade file.
There are some pictures already present where you can test the code.
